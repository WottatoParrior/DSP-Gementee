# Usage
First you need to get this project, navigate to the folder you want to download the project and open a command prompt there.
Use :

git clone https://github.com/WottatoParrior/DSP-Gementee.git

This will download the project to the folder and set up everything you need to create branches,pull and push stuff.


The correct way is to setup a virtual enviornment and install all the dependencies there, so everyone
who uses this project runs the same dependencies and to prevent clashes with current installations.
To do that:

python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate # linux

.\.venv/scripts/activate # windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
